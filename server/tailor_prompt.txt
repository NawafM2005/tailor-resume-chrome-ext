You are an expert resume writer.
I will provide you with a "Job Description" and my "Master Resume" facts.

Your task is to output a JSON object containing tailored content for my resume that best matches the Job Description.

STRICT RULES:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON. No Markdown formatting.
2. Select exactly 5 bullet points for the "TMU Pulse" project from the Master Resume.
3. Select exactly 5 bullet points for the "LectraAI" project from the Master Resume.
4. Create 3 separate skill strings based on the Master Resume Skills Bank:
   - "skill_languages": Comma-separated list of Languages.
   - "skill_frameworks": Comma-separated list of Frameworks & Platforms (include Cloud/DB here).
   - "skill_tools": Comma-separated list of Practices & Tools.
5. DO NOT invent new facts, metrics, or tools. Use ONLY what is in the Master Resume.
6. If the job description emphasizes certain skills (e.g. Python over Java), prioritize those bullets.
7. Highlight key technologies, metrics, and achievements by wrapping them in double asterisks, e.g., **React** or **40%**.

JSON Structure:
{
  "pulse_bullets": [ "bullet 1", "bullet 2", ... ],
  "lectra_bullets": [ "bullet 1", "bullet 2", ... ],
  "skill_languages": "TypeScript, Python, ...",
  "skill_frameworks": "React, Node.js, ...",
  "skill_tools": "Git, Docker, ..."
}
